# CTAB DNA extraction for fungi 

Camille Truong, July 2022.

In our experience, this protocol works better than many expensive kits to extract high quality DNA from a variety of fungal sources (fresh and dry specimens, fungarium, cultures, mycorrhizal roots) including for genome sequencing.

#### 2% CTAB extraction buffer (500 ml):
10 g CTAB solid

288 ml deionized water

50 ml Tris 1M

140 ml NaCl 5M

20 ml EDTA 0.5M

> Sterilize by autoclaving for 20 min at 120ºC


## Procedure
- In the field, sterilize a razor blade with a flame and/or an alcohol wipe and use it to collect fresh material (gills, gleba, root tip) in an Eppendorf tube with 500 µl *2% CTAB extraction buffer*; store at –20ºC before DNA extraction.

> CTAB keeps well at room temperature for several weeks/months

> Using fresh material is ideal but it works for dried material too

- Back to the lab, break down material inside the tube with a sterile pestle while incubating at 65ºC for >30 min; vortex sample every 10 min.

> Optional: 2 µl β-mercaptoethanol can be added at this step to reduce polyphenol contaminations in genomic DNA

- Add 500 µl *isoamyl-chloroform* [1:24]; vortex and centrifuge at max speed (>13,000 rpm) for 20 min.

- Transfer the top phase to a fresh tube (ca. 300-400 µl, using yellow pipet tip) without disturbing the interface.

- Add 400µl *cold isopropanol* (stored in freezer); mix gently and incubate at -20ºC for >1 hour.
> At this stage, the samples can be left in the freezer overnight

- Centrifuge at max speed for 15 min; pour out isopropanol, being careful not to loose the pellet (use pipet tip if necessary).

- Wash the pellet with 500µl *70% ethanol*; mix gently and centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 30 sec. Discard supernatant. Repeat.

- Pour out ethanol (by hand), being careful to not loose the pellet; completely dry the pellet at 65ºC (>30 min) in a dry heater or vacuum centrifuge.

- Resuspend DNA by adding 50-100 µl *TE buffer* (pH 8) or sterile deionized water; incubate at 65ºC for >20 min to degrade potential DNAse residues.

> Optional: once DNA is resuspended, add 1 µl RNAse (final concentration 20 µg/ml) and incubate for >20 min
