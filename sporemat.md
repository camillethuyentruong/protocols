## What are spore mats

Ectomycorrhizal fungi in the Pezizomycetes (Ascomycota) sometimes produce both sexual meiospores (cup or truffles ascocarps) and asexual mitosopores, or conidia, that forms spore mats. The role of these mitotic spores for the life cycle of these fungi is not well understood, but it is believed that they act as spermatia to enhance the likelihood of finding compatible nuclei (outcrossing) in heterothallic species. Failure to colonize roots or germinate mitotic spores in culture seems to indicate that they are not propagative. 


## Where to find spore mats

Spore mats appear on bare soil or below thin litter, often at the border of trails, a few days after rain. If it’s too wet or raining they get flushed away, if it's too dry they won't grow. We don’t know yet if fire stimulate them, but many of these fungi are early successional and therefore important for seedling recruitment.

> Fruitbodies sometimes grow in close vicinity, so it is useful to look for truffles around.


## How to collect spore mats for the herbarium

 - Carefully remove the patch with a knife, including 1-2 cm deep of soil (helps keep it together) and place it in a small container.
   
   > Small Petri dishes work great, otherwise any plastic container or aluminium foil will do.
   
 - Record the date, location, canopy plants (putative mycorrhizal hosts) and basic habitat information.
   
 - While fresh, glue the patch on an archival paper card using diluted school glue and dry it overnight with a dehydrator, or in a closed plastic container with silica gel beads at the bottom.
   > If stored in a Petri dish, the collection can be dried directly by placing the Petri dish in the dehydrator or container with silica
   
 - Store collections in herbarium boxes (or Petri dishes sealed with their lid) horizontally to avoid crashing them.

 ## How to store material for DNA sequencing
Spore mats have few morphological characters and species identification relies mostly on DNA. Luckily they are very easy to sequences!

To extract DNA from spore mats:
 - Sterilize a razor blade with flame and/or an alcohol wipe, and carefully scrap the surface of the spore mat.
 - Store the powdery material in an Eppendorf tube with DNA buffer, such as CTAB or Extract&Amp, and store at -20°C until DNA extraction

> It is easier to sample DNA from fresh material, but dried spore mats will work if stored properly (holding together).
