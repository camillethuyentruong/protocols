# Sampling and preserving mycorrhizal roots

Camille Truong and Guillermo Bueno, August 2022.

This protocol described how to sample plant roots to study their mycorrhizal type, % colonization and root-associated fungi with DNA sequencing.

Back to [mycology protocols](README.md)


## Field sampling

- Sample 3-5 individuals of the species of interest in each population.

- Record the date, location, canopy plants (putative mycorrhizal hosts) and basic habitat information (exposure, slope).

  > If you can, record as much information as possible about the type of vegetation and any soil characteristic of the site, such as soil depth, pH, moisture, etc.

- Using a hand rack, excavate two lateral roots from the trunk until fine roots that are clearly connected to the tree are found.

  > In the case of seedlings or smaller plants, carefully excavate the entire root system without damaging the fine roots.

- Store 2-3 root branches in a Ziplock bag and annotate on which horizon the roots were growing (organic or mineral soil).

- Keep samples refrigerated with icepacks in a cooler until processing.

*Excavation of fine mycorrhizal roots:*

## Processing in the lab, field station or camp

- Clean roots with tap water and put them in a Petri dish.

- Cut fine roots into >20 pieces of ca. 1-2 cm long and check for ectomycorrhizal colonization (under a stereomicroscope if available).

- For DNA, rinse >10 pieces with distilled water, choosing the pieces that look more colonized, and store in an Eppendorf tube with a DNA buffer (such as CTAB); store at -20°C until DNA extraction.

  > In DNA buffer, the samples will keep well at room temperature for several days/weeks.

*Cleaning and sorting out roots for DNA in the field:*

- To preserve roots for staining and anatomical observations you have two options:

  - If possible, save >10 root pieces in 95% ethanol in a Falcon tube and store at 5ºC.
  
    > Room temperature is ok for several days/weeks but *do not freeze*.
  
  - Alternatively, dry root pieces in small envelopes or tea bags with silica gel in a sealed Tupperware, in a dehydrator (below 50°), or even air-drying them in the sun.

*Preservation of dry roots for anatomical observations:*
